# My-Cybersecurity-Course-Repository

## Who am I?
My name is Monica Stygar - I am a techonology and project professional.  I started off my career as a developer working primarily with C, C++, Unix scripting and Transact SQL. I branched into Business anlysis and then Project Management.  I realized I needed way more business knowledge and started on an MBA. I moved into managing larger projects and eventually into management.  I have a good solid background with rich field of experiences I can pull on.

## Why Cybersecurity
There came a point where a lot of the jobs I was interested in wanted a person with more knowledge of Cybersecurity than I had.  I also realized, after focusing on management, I needed to invest some time getting back up to speed on the latest technologies.  The Cybersecurity course seemed to fill in a lot of the gaps in my technology background.  And it is a field I could bring a lot of my structured project management experience with me to help businesses successfully run and manage their Cybersecurity initiatives.

## This Repository
This repository is a collection of the materials I worked on in my UCLA Cybersecurity course.  It represents not only the scope of my education, but also the materials I have collected for future reference.

## What can I find here?
There are all sorts of great things!  Here is a quick summary to get started:
